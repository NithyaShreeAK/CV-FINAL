🖥️ Computer Vision Laboratory 🧑‍💻

Welcome to the Computer Vision Laboratory repository! This repository contains 10 experiments on various computer vision techniques. Each experiment is structured with its own dataset, Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), and documentation (PDF) for a comprehensive learning experience.

🚀 Getting Started
1. Read the Theoretical Documentation:
Open the corresponding ExperimentX.pdf to understand the concepts, experiment objectives, and instructions. This will give you the theoretical background for what you're about to do.
2. Run the Experiment in Jupyter Notebook:
Open the .ipynb file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

If you're using Google Colab, go to https://colab.research.google.com, and either upload the .ipynb file or open it directly from your GitHub repository.

3. Use the Datasets:
The dataset should be placed in the /Dataset/ folder within each experiment directory. To load the data in the notebook, you can use Python libraries such as Pandas (for CSVs) or OpenCV (for images).
